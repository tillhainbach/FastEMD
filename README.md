#  FastEMD-Algorithm

## Description
This repository is an optimized re-implemenation of the FastEMD-Algorithm ("emd hat ground metric") as desribed by Ofir Pele and Michael Werman [1][1] and [2] [2]. It is written such that it performs at least as fast as Rubner's EMD-Implementation for small arrays while being magnitudes faster using larger arrays. Futhermore, this implementation outperforms the orginal implementation. The Interface is designed such that memory is allocated ones and reused on every call to .calcDistance(). This is specially beneficial when iteration over a sequence of histograms of equal sizes (eq. images). 

This implementation can also be used with openCV.

## Usage
Include "EMDHat.hpp" into your project. Create an EMDHat-instance by calling the initializer with the number of weights / histogram size as input parameter.

You may specify an input number type (all integer types and double) and your preferred interface type (STL (vector or array) or openCV).

To calculate the distance for a given set of weights P and Q, call the .calcDistance() class method.
Example code can be found in the src folder.

## Notes
Calculation of Flow has not been implemented yet. Additionally, this implementation always assumes metric property for the ground distance!
